# Image Classification with CIFAR-10 dataset use LeNet-5 Architecture

This notebook want to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 
You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples.

Some of the code and description of this notebook is provided by Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program and from this repo :

https://github.com/deep-diver/CIFAR10-img-classification-tensorflow

This notebook has been reproduced by my self for learn CNN used Tensorflow and **try implement LeNet-5 Architecture**
